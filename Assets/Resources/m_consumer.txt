anyone see the new marvel movie

My last point I will make on this, Marvel movies by and large, are trash. Like really bad. You grown men crying over this shit need a wake up call. You are all so fake it makes me sick. You are media puppets. These films are trash. Endgame is TRASH. You people don't know what a fucking good movie looks like. I could write a film twice as good as Endgame. I am a free thinker not a sheep and I know myself. I know more about these characters than 90% of these "fans" since I actually read comics. These guys are all posers, just pathetic idiots with no mind of their own. Being lead along like a little puppy while Kevin Fiege takes all your money. You all make me SICK. I've read comics way better than anything in MCU. Stop being such a bunch of plastic CUNTS and stop following the mainstream. Get a fucking brain and then have the fucking gunts to use it to follow what YOU actually like. This posing, this trying to fit it. It's PATHETIC. Marvel shills make me SICK.

Since when do people care about some critics who never touched a comic book in their life?
Phase 4 has been diverse, strong, fun, funny, eclectic and galvanising. By all accounts the train is going full speed ahead, with memorable new exciting ideas in phase 5. Never doubt Kevin Feige. Do so at your own peril.
STOP Panicking! Dont falter! Buy tickets, watch the movie, if you dont quite get it, watch it again, look for the details, commit and you will understand and like it long term.
As Marvel fans its our duty to support our dreams on the screen. Dont let some paid critic haters (who want hate clicks btw) tell you where your heart should be.
Marvel forever.
