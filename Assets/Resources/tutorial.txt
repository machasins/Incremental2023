Hey AmourWrath superfan!!

You've been selected to be a <b>Moderator</b> for AmourWrath! Woohoo!



All that you need to do is <b>ban</b> anyone that doesn't follow the rules. 



To ban someone, just <b>right</b> click on their message and click ban! Simple!



Every justified ban will earn you some <b>Good Boy Points</b> (GBP)!





The rules are simple:
